## ToDo application

Build a Todo application using the command line as an interface. User can add todos and will see their todo list printed to STDout when a new one is added. Users can removed todos once completed. 

### Planning 

To keep code flexible we will use two classes. Todo and and interface. This will allow the logic to be used if user chooses to use the app with browser. 

### Inputs/Outputs 

| Inputs               | Outputs|
| -------------------  | -----  |
